# Go Movies

A movie/tv-show review website where users can rate, add-to-list, and browse their favourite content and critics can write their reviews accessible to other users. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need MonogDb and Node installed on your machine to build and run the project locally.

Please download the latest [mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#enterprise) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) versions. Verify both are installed by using the following commands.

```
$ mongod --version
